My name is "Kuro Kodoku", a Computer Science student at Satbayev University, currently working towards my Bachelorâ€™s degree (graduating in 2026). Iâ€™ve finished Almaty Polytech College before this, and since then Iâ€™ve never stopped exploring what technology can do.

Iâ€™m the kind of person who likes to figure things out â€” whether itâ€™s building applications, developing games, diving into graphics programming, experimenting with OS development, tweaking system architectures, or poking around with machine learning and AI. I enjoy solving problems from scratch and building basic architectures that make sense and scale well.

Iâ€™ve had experience leading teams, making sure ideas actually become working projects. I care about design too â€” from digital UI/UX to cinematography, CGI, and creative tech.

Some other fields Iâ€™m into? Robotics, custom microprocessors with Arduino, electronics engineering, database management, code modification, digital design â€” honestly, if itâ€™s interesting, Iâ€™m probably tinkering with it.

I speak Kazakh, Russian, and English fluently â€” so feel free to reach out in any of them.

Iâ€™m always up for new challenges, ideas, or collaborations. If youâ€™re building something cool â€” or weird â€” Iâ€™d probably love to hear about it.
